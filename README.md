# GWAS of Manzanita Glandular Hairs

This was just a fun project I did. It would need to be repeated with more rigor in the future. The goal is to use a species complex of *Arctostaphylos spp.* with RAD-seq data from [Huang et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1496) and combine this with the K-mer based GWAS concept from [Rahman et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32920) and [Voichek et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-020-0612-7).

I suspect that this will allow you to perform a GWA on higher taxonomic levels than have previously been attempted and potentially retrieve the genetic basis of conserved (and potentially diagnostic) traits.
